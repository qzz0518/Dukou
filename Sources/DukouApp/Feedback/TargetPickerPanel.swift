/// The question 「发送到自定义」 asks, now that the extension has no interface
/// to ask it in.
///
/// The share extension used to draw this list inside the host's share sheet.
/// That is the panel the user called 「无敌丑」 (2026-09-05): it arrives with the
/// system's sheet animation, over WeChat, before anything has happened. Asking
/// here instead costs one floating capsule in the corner the shelf lives in —
/// the same surface every other Dukou message uses — and it only appears when
/// there is a genuine choice to make: no apps and one app are answered without
/// showing anything at all (`CustomForwardDecision`).
///
/// Two rules learned from a bug the user found in the first build of this panel
/// (a grey fragment beside the shelf, showing a sliver of two app icons):
///
/// 1. **The window is built and thrown away with the question.** A panel that
///    outlives the request it belongs to is a window nothing is waiting for and
///    nothing will ever close.
/// 2. **The size comes from a value, not from a published property.** The list
///    used to reach the view through an `ObservableObject`, and SwiftUI applies
///    those on a later turn of the run loop — so `fittingSize`, measured on the
///    spot, reported the height of the *previous* content. The window was sized
///    for an empty list and the two rows that arrived a moment later were drawn
///    clipped inside it. The rows are a plain `let` now, so assigning `rootView`
///    and laying out is enough to measure them.

/// This used to present a panel in the host's share sheet saying what Dukou was
/// doing. Measured on the signed build and rejected by the user (2026-09-05
/// evening): the sheet arrives with the system's own zoom animation, sits over
/// WeChat for the best part of a second and reports something the user can
/// already see happen. A copy step has nothing to say.
///
/// **Measured, not assumed**: the interface cannot be removed outright.
/// `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` was pointed at an `NSExtensionRequestHandling`
/// object with no view at all, and both attempts (main-actor and detached,
/// 2026-09-05 17:00 and 17:01, `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/DukouShare-*.ips`)
/// died the same way: `-[NSSharingUIExtensionContext viewController]` asserts
/// and the process is killed with SIGTRAP a few seconds in, after the bytes
/// have been copied and before the batch is committed. `com.apple.share-services`
/// requires a view controller.
///
/// So this is §12.1's documented fallback, and the honest description of it is:
/// there is still a view, it is 1×1 and transparent, and the host still opens
/// and closes a sheet around it. The import starts in `viewDidLoad` — before
/// the sheet is on screen, not after — and the request is completed the
/// instant the files are durable, with no pause for a confirmation that no
/// longer exists.
///
/// The Objective-C name is pinned because `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` is
/// resolved through the Objective-C runtime: a Swift class would otherwise be
/// looked up under its mangled, module-qualified name, which changes if the
/// target is ever renamed.

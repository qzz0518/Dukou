/// is gone — the extension has no interface at all now (ADR-0005), and the app
/// makes the same offer on its own failure capsule, in-process. So nothing in
/// this tree opens one of these any more; the scheme stays registered and
/// routed because it is the app's front door for anything that wants to point
/// at a settings pane, and because dropping a shipped URL scheme is a decision
/// of its own.
///
/// Declared here because two places have to agree on the spelling: the app
/// delegate that routes it and `Resources/Info.plist`'s `CFBundleURLTypes` —
/// which is asserted by `Scripts/check-release-config.sh`, since a scheme that
/// is not registered fails by doing nothing at all.

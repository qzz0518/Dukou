#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Creates a self-signed code-signing identity so Dukou keeps its Accessibility
# permission across rebuilds.
#
# WHY: an ad-hoc signature (`codesign --sign -`) has no stable identity — its code
# requirement is the binary's own cdhash. macOS pins the Accessibility grant to
# that, so every rebuild produces a "new app" and the automated ⌘V stops working
# until the user re-grants it. Signing with a real certificate, even a
# self-signed one, gives a stable requirement and the grant survives.
#
# `make-app.sh` already prefers a Developer ID or Apple Development identity from
# the keychain; this is for a Mac that has neither. It adds a certificate to YOUR
# login keychain and will ask for your password.
#
#   Scripts/make-signing-identity.sh            # create it
#   IDENTITY="Dukou Dev" Scripts/make-app.sh    # then build with it
set -euo pipefail

This will create a self-signed code-signing certificate named "$NAME" in your
login keychain. Certificate Assistant cannot be driven from a script, so do it
once by hand:

  1. Open Keychain Access
  2. Menu: Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Create a Certificate…
  3. Name: $NAME
     Identity Type: Self Signed Root
     Certificate Type: Code Signing
     (leave "Let me override defaults" unchecked)
  4. Create, then Done

Then build with:

  IDENTITY="$NAME" Scripts/make-app.sh

The first launch after that still asks for Accessibility once. Every rebuild
afterwards keeps it.
